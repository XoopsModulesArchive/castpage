<h2>Installing</h2>
Installation of the castpage module is just like installing any other
xoops modle.  <br>Upload the files to your modules directory, and from the Admin Console, select
"System Admin" button and select "Modules".<Br>
Scroll down towards the bottom and find the cast page icon. Click on "Install" and you are ready to go.

<h2>Setup</h2>
From the Admin panel, select the cast page icon <img src="../images/castpage.png">.
Click on "setup".<br>
The options for you to fill out are:
<pre>
Title:   The name of the webcomic or site, or whatever.
Next Image:   An image you want displayed if you have multiple chapters.
              This image, when clicked, will goto the next chapter. 
              Image will need to be in the "images" folder under the castpage module.
Prev Image:   An image you want displayed, that when clicked, it will go to
              the previous chapter.
Image size X: These are the size requirements for the prev/next images. 
              Set either X or Y to 0 to remove size limitation.
Image size Y:
First Seen text: Text to be displayed above each castmember to say what chapter they
              where introduced.
